- Documentation: Add example of automatic data ingestion with bind mount (for data migration between boca-docker instances);
- Bug?: Rethink docker/dev/web/init.sh (only create database if non-privileged user cannot connect after user creation?);
- Tests: Propose automatic tests for build images (e.g., run example problems in regular programming languages);
